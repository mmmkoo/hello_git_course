# Hello GIT course

The course spun over five chapters, each covering different parts of GIT.

> The course is graded pass/fail with 1-3 credits available. For one credit, you need at least 80 points which is the amount of points available in rounds 1 and 2. For two credits at least 192 points is needed i.e. adding the points for round 3. Finally, for full three credits at last 272 points is needed adding the round 4 to the work. Round 5 can be used to make up for lost points.

The first chapter is in Finnish and this goes on until basic exercises in the chapter 2. This couldn't be helped since course materials are fixed to the language used at the time of returning the answers.
